# Code Refactor Horiseon Website

## Description

By deploying the refactored Horiseon website, I am taking a step towards making the internet a more accessible place for everyone. I believe that providing access to all ranges of auditory is essential in today's world, and I have included all the necessary components to meet accessibility standards to my knowledge. Through my research and application of semantic HTML elements, "alt" attributes, and proper heading attribute ordering, I am confident that the website is now more accessible than before.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The Horiseon website has been restructured to enhance user navigation. Semantic HTML elements have been employed in place of non-semantic ones, resulting in a more organized and intuitive layout. Additionally, the content has been arranged hierarchically using heading tags, further improving the user experience. These changes have been implemented to ensure that you can easily locate and access the information you require.
